INTRODUCTION                                    *zzzomg*

zzzomg is a last-resort fallback for setting the filetype when no other method
stepped up to the plate.

RATIONALE                                       *zzzomg-rationale*

Some syntax plugin writers forget or don't know how to or just don't plain
care to release an ftdetect script with their masterpieces, leaving Vim users
to have to create entries in their ~/.vimrc to source the syntax file
themselves. This plugin relieves that burden for the simple case where the
target file extension matches the syntax file name, which is probably a fair
number.

FILETYPE DETECTION METHOD                       *zzzomg-detection-method*

zzzomg looks at the extension of the file being edited or created. If a
corresponding syntax file exists somewhere in your |runtimepath| and the
filetype has not already been set, then zzzomg will set the filetype to that
extension.
